## Introduction

The Yarp-OpenMCT tool is meant for visualizing and plotting telemetry data from iCub sensors, published over a Yarp network. It collects sensor data published on a predefined set of Yarp output ports opened by the Yarp Robot Interface and exposes that data on predefined telemetry nodes within the visualizer interface as vectors or scalar signals. The pipeline can be summarized as follows:
- A telemetry data server reads the data from a Yarp port, then available within the server as realtime data.
- The data is buffered in a FIFO queue of predefined depth, and in parallel streamed over a [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/docs/v4) connection to the registered visualizer client (*).
- The data is accessible via the respective telemetry node in the visualizer interface, in the left-hand tree under the "+Create" button. Any object visible in that tree is referred to as a "Domain Object" in the Open MCT glossary.

All telemetry nodes exposing sensor measurements shall appear under the folder "iCub Telemetry". They can then be combined in workspace layouts at the user convenience.

The visualizer implementation is based on the [Open MCT](https://github.com/nasa/openmct) (Open Mission Control Technologies), open source, next-generation mission control framework for visualization of data on desktop and mobile devices. It is developed at NASA's Ames Research Center, and is being used by NASA for data analysis of spacecraft missions, as well as planning and operation of experimental rover systems.

Footnote (*): The [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/docs/v4) connection wraps a [Websocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) protocol. The client tries to establish a websocket connection whenever possible, and falls back to HTTP long polling otherwise.


## Example

For instance, in the context of a simulation on Gazebo, the iCub head IMU measurements read on the port `/icubSim/inertial` are sent over a local network to the visualization tool client and exposed as a telemetry node, referred to as a "Domain Object" in the Open MCT nomenclature. The telemetry node wraps all the 12 measurement components:
- The orientation estimation Roll, Pitch and Yaw.
- The accelerometer measuremtents x, y, z components.
- The gyroscope measuremtents x, y, z components.
- The magnetometer measuremtents x, y, z components.
